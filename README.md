# Frontity Slot Block

Insert a Frontity Slot in the block editor (aka Gutenberg).

## Description

This plugin adds a new block to the block editor called _Frontity Slot_, that inserts a Frontity Slot directly in the content.

It requires the _Slot Block_ processor, which is exported in the `@frontity/html2react` package:

```js
import slotBlock from "@frontity/html2react/processors/slot-block";

export default {
  state: {
    // ...
  },
  actions: {
    // ...
  },
  libraries: {
    html2react: {
      processors: [slotBlock],
    },
  },
};
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the benefit of using this block instead of just an html2react processor?

Both approaches work, but using Frontity Slots is more explicit, clean, and should be easier to maintain.
